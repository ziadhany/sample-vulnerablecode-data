  - VC-OPENSSL-20160921-CVE-2016-6308
summary: 'A DTLS message includes 3 bytes for its length in the header for the message. This
  would allow for messages up to 16Mb in length. Messages of this length are excessive and OpenSSL
  includes a check to ensure that a peer is sending reasonably sized messages in order to avoid
  too much memory being consumed to service a connection. A flaw in the logic of version 1.1.0
  means that memory for the message is allocated too early, prior to the excessive message length
  check. Due to way memory is allocated in OpenSSL this could mean an attacker could force up
  to 21Mb to be allocated to service a connection. This could lead to a Denial of Service through
  memory exhaustion. However, the excessive message length check still takes place, and this
  would cause the connection to immediately fail. Assuming that the application calls SSL_free()
  on the failed conneciton in a timely manner then the 21Mb of allocated memory will then be
  immediately freed again. Therefore the excessive memory allocation will be transitory in nature.
  This then means that there is only a security impact if: 1) The application does not call
  SSL_free() in a timely manner in the event that the connection fails or 2) The application
  is working in a constrained environment where there is very little free memory or 3) The attacker
  initiates multiple connection attempts such that there are multiple connections in a state
  where memory has been allocated for the connection; SSL_free() has not yet been called; and
  there is insufficient memory to service the multiple requests. Except in the instance of (1)
  above any Denial Of Service is likely to be transitory because as soon as the connection fails
  the memory is subsequently freed again in the SSL_free() call. However there is an increased
  risk during this period of application crashes due to the lack of memory - which would then
  mean a more serious Denial of Service.'
