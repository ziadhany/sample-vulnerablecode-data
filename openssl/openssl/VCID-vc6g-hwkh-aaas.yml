  - VC-OPENSSL-20141015
summary: OpenSSL has added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV to allow applications to block the
  ability for a MITM attacker to force a protocol downgrade. Some client applications (such
  as browsers) will reconnect using a downgraded protocol to work around interoperability bugs
  in older servers. This could be exploited by an active man-in-the-middle to downgrade connections
  to SSL 3.0 even if both sides of the connection support higher protocols. SSL 3.0 contains
  a number of weaknesses including POODLE (CVE-2014-3566). See also https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00
  and https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf
