aliases:
  - CVE-2021-40830
  - GHSA-c4rh-4376-gff4
  - PYSEC-2021-863
summary: 'The AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Java, Python, C++ and Node.js appends a user supplied
  Certificate Authority (CA) to the root CAs instead of overriding it on Unix systems. TLS handshakes
  will thus succeed if the peer can be verified either from the user-supplied CA or the system’s
  default trust-store. Attackers with access to a host’s trust stores or are able to compromise
  a certificate authority already in the host''s trust store (note: the attacker must also be
  able to spoof DNS in this case) may be able to use this issue to bypass CA pinning. An attacker
  could then spoof the MQTT broker, and either drop traffic and/or respond with the attacker''s
  data, but they would not be able to forward this data on to the MQTT broker because the attacker
  would still need the user''s private keys to authenticate against the MQTT broker. The ''aws_tls_ctx_options_override_default_trust_store_*''
  function within the aws-c-io submodule has been updated to override the default trust store.
  This corrects this issue. This issue affects: Amazon Web Services AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for
  Java versions prior to 1.5.0 on Linux/Unix. Amazon Web Services AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for
  Python versions prior to 1.6.1 on Linux/Unix. Amazon Web Services AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for
  C++ versions prior to 1.12.7 on Linux/Unix. Amazon Web Services AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for
  Node.js versions prior to 1.5.3 on Linux/Unix. Amazon Web Services AWS-C-IO 0.10.4 on Linux/Unix.'
