vulnerability_id: VCID-g1ch-murf-aaah
aliases:
  - CVE-2020-13948
  - PYSEC-2020-222
summary: While investigating a bug report on Apache Superset, it was determined that an authenticated
  user could craft requests via a number of templated text fields in the product that would
  allow arbitrary access to Pythonâ€™s `os` package in the web application process in versions
  < 0.37.1. It was thus possible for an authenticated user to list and access files, environment
  variables, and process information. Additionally it was possible to set environment variables
  for the current process, create and update files in folders writable by the web process, and
  execute arbitrary programs accessible by the web process. All other operations available to
  the `os` package in Python were also available, even if not explicitly enumerated in this
  CVE.
