  - GHSA-p867-fxfr-ph2w
  - PYSEC-2022-33
summary: b2-sdk-python is a python library to access cloud storage provided by backblaze. Linux
  and Mac releases of the SDK version 1.14.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability
  that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use
  (TOCTOU) race condition. SDK users of the SqliteAccountInfo format are vulnerable while users
  of the InMemoryAccountInfo format are safe. The SqliteAccountInfo saves API keys (and bucket
  name-to-id mapping) in a local database file ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info, ~/.b2_account_info
  or a user-defined path). When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically
  a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory containing the
  file is readable by a local attacker then during the brief period between file creation and
  permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle
  to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive
  information has been saved to it. Consumers of this SDK who rely on it to save data using
  SqliteAccountInfo class should upgrade to the latest version of the SDK. Those who believe
  a local user might have opened a handle using this race condition, should remove the affected
  database files and regenerate all application keys. Users should upgrade to b2-sdk-python
  1.14.1 or later.
