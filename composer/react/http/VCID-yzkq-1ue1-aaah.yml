aliases:
  - CVE-2022-36032
  - GHSA-w3w9-vrf5-8mx8
summary: ReactPHP HTTP is a streaming HTTP client and server implementation for ReactPHP. In
  ReactPHP's HTTP server component versions starting with 0.7.0 and prior to 1.7.0, when ReactPHP
  is processing incoming HTTP cookie values, the cookie names are url-decoded. This may lead
  to cookies with prefixes like `__Host-` and `__Secure-` confused with cookies that decode
  to such prefix, thus leading to an attacker being able to forge cookie which is supposed to
  be secure. This issue is fixed in ReactPHP HTTP version 1.7.0. As a workaround, Infrastructure
  or DevOps can place a reverse proxy in front of the ReactPHP HTTP server to filter out any
  unexpected `Cookie` request headers.
