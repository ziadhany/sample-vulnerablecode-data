  Remote Code Execution
  Your application is affected if you allow end users to submit Twig templates, even if you protected this template with Twig's sandbox mode. End users can craft valid Twig code that allows them to execute arbitrary code (RCEs) via the _self variable, which is always available, even in sandboxed templates.
