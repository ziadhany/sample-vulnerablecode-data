  Potential Insufficient Entropy
  There are several methods used to generate random numbers in ZF1 that potentially used insufficient entropy. Moreover, there's a potential security issue in the usage of the `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()` function in `Zend_Crypt_Math::randBytes`, reported in PHP BUG #70014, and the security implications reported in a discussion on the `random_compat` library.
