aliases:
  - CVE-2022-45152
summary: A blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was found in Moodle. This
  flaw exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in LTI provider library.
  The library does not utilise Moodle's inbuilt cURL helper, which resulted in a blind SSRF
  risk. An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request and trick the application to initiate
  requests to arbitrary systems. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to perform SSRF
  attacks.
