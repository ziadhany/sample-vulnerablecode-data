aliases:
  - CVE-2020-6165
summary: |
  Incorrect Default Permissions
  The automatic permission-checking mechanism in the `silverstripe/graphql` module does not provide complete protection against lists that are limited (e.g., through pagination), resulting in records that should have failed a permission check being added to the final result set. GraphQL endpoints are configured by default (e.g., for assets), but the `admin/graphql` endpoint is access protected by default. This limits the vulnerability to all authenticated users, including those with limited permissions (e.g., where viewing records exposed through `admin/graphql` requires administrator permissions). However, if custom GraphQL endpoints have been configured for a specific implementation (usually under `/graphql`), this vulnerability could also be exploited through unauthenticated requests. This vulnerability only applies to reading records; it does not allow unauthorised changing of records.
