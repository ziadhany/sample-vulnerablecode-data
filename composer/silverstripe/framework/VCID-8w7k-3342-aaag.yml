summary: |
  Member.Name isn't escaped
  The core template `framework/templates/Includes/GridField_print.ss` uses "Printed by $Member.Name". If the currently logged in members first name or surname contain XSS, this prints the raw HTML out, because `Member->getName()` just returns the raw `FirstName + Surname` as a string, which is injected directly.
