  Missing security check on dev/build/defaults
  The `buildDefaults` method on `DevelopmentAdmin` is missing a permission check. In live mode, if you access /dev/build, you are requested to login first. However, if you access /dev/build/defaults, then the action is performed without any login check. This should be protected in the same way that /dev/build is. The `buildDefaults` view is `requireDefaultRecords()` on each `DataObject` class, and hence has the potential to modify database state. It also lists all modified tables, allowing attackers more insight into which modules are used, and how the database tables are structured.
