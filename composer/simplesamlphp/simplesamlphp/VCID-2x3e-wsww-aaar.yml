  Link injection
  `www/logout.php` and `modules/core/www/no_cookie.php` are not checking the URLs obtained via the HTTP request before displaying them as the target of links that the user may click on. It allows attackers to display links targeting a malicious website inside a trusted site running SimpleSAMLphp, due to the lack of security checks involving the `link_href` and `retryURL` HTTP parameters, respectively.
