  - GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h
summary: JSON5 is an extension to the popular JSON file format that aims to be easier to write
  and maintain by hand (e.g. for config files). The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before
  and including version `2.2.1` does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing
  specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This vulnerability
  pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype,
  which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the
  prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the
  object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to
  set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact
  will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys,
  but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in
  extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse` should restrict parsing of `__proto__`
  keys when parsing JSON strings to objects. As a point of reference, the `JSON.parse` method
  included in JavaScript ignores `__proto__` keys. Simply changing `JSON5.parse` to `JSON.parse`
  in the examples above mitigates this vulnerability. This vulnerability is patched in json5
  version 2.2.2 and later.
