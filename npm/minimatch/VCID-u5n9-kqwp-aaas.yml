  Regular Expression Denial of Service
  The primary function, `minimatch(path, pattern)` is vulnerable to ReDoS in the `pattern` parameter. This is because of the regular expression on line of minimatch.js: `/((?:\\{2})*)(\\?)\|/g,`. The problematic portion of the regex is `((?:\\{2})*)` which matches against `//`.
