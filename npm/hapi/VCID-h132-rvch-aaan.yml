summary: |
  rosetta-flash jsonp vulnerability
  Someone created a alphanum only swf converter, which means that they can in theory use it as a callback at a JSONP endpoint, and as a result, send data across domains. Prepending callbacks with an empty inline comment breaks the flash parser, and prevents the issue. This is a fairly common solution currently being implemented by Google, Facebook, and Github.
