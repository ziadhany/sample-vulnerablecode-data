summary: |
  Route level CORS config overrides connection level defaults
  When server level, connection level or route level CORS configurations are combined and when a higher level config included security restrictions (like origin), a higher level config that included security restrictions (like origin) would have those restrictions overridden by less restrictive defaults (e.g. origin defaults to all origins `*`).
