vulnerability_id: VCID-dnsm-rvd2-aaak
aliases:
  - CVE-2022-31127
  - GHSA-pgjx-7f9g-9463
summary: 'NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications.
  An attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider)
  that contains some malicious HTML, tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user, so they
  can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com, <a href="http://attacker.com">Before
  signing in, claim your money!</a>`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com`, and the
  content of the email containing a link to the attacker''s site was rendered in the HTML. This
  has been remedied in the following releases, by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML,
  since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before
  version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained.
  next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade,
  the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest`
  and rendered in the HTML. If you haven''t created a custom `sendVerificationRequest`, you
  only need to upgrade. Otherwise, make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or
  efficiently sanitize it.'
