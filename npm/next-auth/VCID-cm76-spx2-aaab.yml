aliases:
  - CVE-2022-31186
  - GHSA-p6mm-27gq-9v3p
summary: 'NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications.
  An information disclosure vulnerability in `next-auth` before `v4.10.2` and `v3.29.9` allows
  an attacker with log access privilege to obtain excessive information such as an identity
  provider''s secret in the log (which is thrown during OAuth error handling) and use it to
  leverage further attacks on the system, like impersonating the client to ask for extensive
  permissions. This issue has been patched in `v4.10.2` and `v3.29.9` by moving the log for
  `provider` information to the debug level. In addition, we added a warning for having the
  `debug: true` option turned on in production. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can
  user the `logger` configuration option by sanitizing the logs.'
