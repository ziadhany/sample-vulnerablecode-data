aliases:
  - CVE-2022-31146
  - GHSA-5fhj-g3p3-pq9g
summary: Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. There is a bug in the Wasmtime's
  code generator, Cranelift, where functions using reference types may be incorrectly missing
  metadata required for runtime garbage collection. This means that if a GC happens at runtime
  then the GC pass will mistakenly think these functions do not have live references to GC'd
  values, reclaiming them and deallocating them. The function will then subsequently continue
  to use the values assuming they had not been GC'd, leading later to a use-after-free. This
  bug was introduced in the migration to the `regalloc2` register allocator that occurred in
  the Wasmtime 0.37.0 release on 2022-05-20. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade
  to Wasmtime version 0.38.2. Mitigations for this issue can be achieved by disabling the reference
  types proposal by passing `false` to `wasmtime::Config::wasm_reference_types` or downgrading
  to Wasmtime 0.36.0 or prior.
