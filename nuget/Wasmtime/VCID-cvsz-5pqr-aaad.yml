summary: Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly & WASI. Wasmtime before version
  0.30.0 is affected by a type confusion vulnerability. As a Rust library the `wasmtime` crate
  clearly marks which functions are safe and which are `unsafe`, guaranteeing that if consumers
  never use `unsafe` then it should not be possible to have memory unsafety issues in their
  embeddings of Wasmtime. An issue was discovered in the safe API of `Linker::func_*` APIs.
  These APIs were previously not sound when one `Engine` was used to create the `Linker` and
  then a different `Engine` was used to create a `Store` and then the `Linker` was used to instantiate
  a module into that `Store`. Cross-`Engine` usage of functions is not supported in Wasmtime
  and this can result in type confusion of function pointers, resulting in being able to safely
  call a function with the wrong type. Triggering this bug requires using at least two `Engine`
  values in an embedding and then additionally using two different values with a `Linker` (one
  at the creation time of the `Linker` and another when instantiating a module with the `Linker`).
  It's expected that usage of more-than-one `Engine` in an embedding is relatively rare since
  an `Engine` is intended to be a globally shared resource, so the expectation is that the impact
  of this issue is relatively small. The fix implemented is to change this behavior to `panic!()`
  in Rust instead of silently allowing it. Using different `Engine` instances with a `Linker`
  is a programmer bug that `wasmtime` catches at runtime. This bug has been patched and users
  should upgrade to Wasmtime version 0.30.0. If you cannot upgrade Wasmtime and are using more
  than one `Engine` in your embedding it's recommended to instead use only one `Engine` for
  the entire program if possible. An `Engine` is designed to be a globally shared resource that
  is suitable to have only one for the lifetime of an entire process. If using multiple `Engine`s
  is required then code should be audited to ensure that `Linker` is only used with one `Engine`.
